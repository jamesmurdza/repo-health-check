This isn't possible at the moment since React alters the value from `StructuredCallSite#getScriptNameOrSourceURL` in a way that is incompatible with how Node.js uses this value as a key in its internal source map cache. This mostly works for files with just alphanumeric characters. But it breaks when e.g. square brackets or spaces are used in file paths.\r\n\r\nThe only alternative in Node.js is implementing `findSourceMapURL` by getting the source map payload based on the original source URL and serializing that into a `data:` URL. Not only is this wasteful due to the added serialization+deserialization step, it also significantly increases memory consumption since Node.js holds onto source maps forever and doesn't deduplicate sourcemaps on source mapping URLs. Deduplication based on source map URLs is definitely something we should contribute upstream regardless. GCing source maps may be more involved. And then we'd still have the overhead of added serialization+deserialization. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlternate to https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/33731", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/33969/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/33969/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/33964", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/33964/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/33964/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/33964/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/33964", "id": 3253232013, "node_id": "PR_kwDOAJy2Ks6gGfMA", "number": 33964, "title": "[devtools]: Prevent false positive render detection in profiler (#33423, #19732)", "user": {"login": "developerjhp", "id": 85682854, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjg1NjgyODU0", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85682854?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/developerjhp", "html_url": "https://github.com/developerjhp", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/developerjhp/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/developerjhp/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/developerjhp/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/developerjhp/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/developerjhp/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/developerjhp/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/developerjhp/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/developerjhp/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/developerjhp/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 196858374, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxOTY4NTgzNzQ=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/labels/CLA%20Signed", "name": "CLA Signed", "color": "e7e7e7", "default": false, "description": null}], "state": "open", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2025-07-22T15:53:29Z", "updated_at": "2025-07-23T07:55:27Z", "closed_at": null, "author_association": "NONE", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/pulls/33964", "html_url": "https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/33964", "diff_url": "https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/33964.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/33964.patch", "merged_at": null}, "body": "## Summary\r\n Fixes a bug in React DevTools where the profiler incorrectly reported sibling components as re-rendered when they were nested under HostComponents (like `<div>`) that get filtered out by DevTools. This affected profiler data collection, render highlighting, and inspector cache management.\r\n\r\n## Background\r\n  React DevTools filters out DOM elements (HostComponents) by default to focus on user components. However, this filtering created a blind spot where sibling components under the same HostComponent parent would be incorrectly reported as re-rendered even when their Fiber objects remained identical.\r\n  This is a follow-up to #33434\r\n  \r\n## Previous Attempt & Learning\r\n#33434 helped identify that the issue wasn't with `didFiberRender` logic itself, but with **when it was being called**. The filtering behavior provided the key insight that components with identical Fiber objects shouldn't trigger render\r\n    detection when their parent HostComponents are filtered.\r\n\r\n##  Example scenario:\r\n  ```javascript\r\nconst Count = () => {\r\n    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\r\n    console.log('Count Component Rerendered');\r\n    return (\r\n        <button onClick={() => setCount(c => c + 1)}>\r\n            Count: {count}\r\n        </button>\r\n    );\r\n};\r\n\r\nconst Greeting = () => {\r\n    console.log('Greeting Component Rerendered');\r\n    return <span>Hello World!</span>;\r\n};\r\n\r\nconst App = () => {\r\n    const [appState, setAppState] = useState(0);\r\n    console.log('App Component Rerendered');\r\n    \r\n    return (\r\n        <main>\r\n            <div>App State: {appState}</div>\r\n            <button onClick={() => setAppState(s => s + 1)}>\r\n                App Rerender Trigger (All children rerender)\r\n            </button>\r\n            <hr />\r\n            <Count />\r\n            <div>\r\n                <Greeting />\r\n            </div>\r\n        </main>\r\n    );\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n##  Root Cause\r\n\r\n  The issue occurred because didFiberRender was being called for components whose Fiber objects remained referentially identical (prevFiber === nextFiber) but were nested under HostComponents. When the parent HostComponent processed its children during reconciliation, DevTools would check all child components without recognizing that some hadn't actually re-rendered.\r\n\r\n## Key insight \r\nIf prevFiber === nextFiber and the parent is a filtered HostComponent, then didFiberRender shouldn't be called at all - not because the function is wrong, but because the component genuinely hasn't re-rendered.\r\n\r\n##  Solution\r\n  Instead of modifying didFiberRender logic, this fix prevents the function from being called when we can objectively determine a component hasn't re-rendered. The fix adds conditional checks in three critical locations:\r\n\r\n  1. Profiler Data Collection (renderer.js:2816)\r\n   - Prevents false positive entries in profiler commit data when components haven't actually re-rendered.\r\n\r\n  2. Render Highlighting (renderer.js:3327)\r\n  - Prevents incorrect highlighting of components during trace updates when they haven't changed.\r\n\r\n  3. Inspector Cache Management (renderer.js:3359)\r\n  - Preserves cached inspection data when components haven't actually re-rendered, avoiding unnecessary re-computation.\r\n\r\n##  Implementation Details\r\n  The fix uses objective criteria to detect when didFiberRender shouldn't be called:\r\n```jsx\r\n  if (\r\n    prevFiber === nextFiber &&  // Same Fiber object reference\r\n    nextFiber.return != null &&\r\n    (nextFiber.return.tag === HostComponent || nextFiber.return.tag === HostSingleton)  // Parent is filtered HostComponent\r\n  ) {\r\n    // Don't call didFiberRender - component hasn't actually re-rendered\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n  This approach:\r\n  - Addresses false positives at the source\r\n  - Maintains existing didFiberRender logic unchanged\r\n  - Applies consistently across all DevTools features\r\n  - Uses objective, verifiable criteria\r\n  - No performance impact on normal rendering\r\n\r\n  Related Issues\r\n\r\n  Fixes #33423, #19732", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/33964/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/33964/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/33951", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/33951/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/33951/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/33951/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/33951", "id": 3246564770, "node_id": "PR_kwDOAJy2Ks6fvrKJ", "number": 33951, "title": "Fix: Prevent Stringification of Symbol and Function values in value/defaultValue attributes.", "user": {"login": "saylik365", "id": 159431703, "node_id": "U_kgDOCYC8Fw", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/159431703?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/saylik365", "html_url": "https://github.com/saylik365", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/saylik365/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/saylik365/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/saylik365/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/saylik365/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/saylik365/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/saylik365/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/saylik365/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/saylik365/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/saylik365/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 196858374, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxOTY4NTgzNzQ=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/labels/CLA%20Signed", "name": "CLA Signed", "color": "e7e7e7", "default": false, "description": null}], "state": "open", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 3, "created_at": "2025-07-20T18:17:51Z", "updated_at": "2025-07-20T19:20:19Z", "closed_at": null, "author_association": "NONE", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/pulls/33951", "html_url": "https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/33951", "diff_url": "https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/33951.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/33951.patch", "merged_at": null}, "body": "<!--\r\n  Thanks for submitting a pull request!\r\n  We appreciate you spending the time to work on these changes.

This is not valid behavior, as these types are non-serializable and should be ignored.\r\n\r\nThis PR ensures:\r\n\r\n1. `value` and `defaultValue` props with `Symbol `or `Function` values are now ignored and excluded from the DOM.\r\n2. Such attributes are removed from the DOM if dynamically updated with a `Symbol` or `Function`.\r\n3. Clear console warnings appear in development mode, informing developers of incorrect usage.\r\n4. This fix brings the behavior in line with React\u2019s handling of invalid or non-serializable attributes elsewhere in the system.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Explain the **motivation** for making this change. What existing problem does the pull request solve?\r\n-->\r\n### Motivation\r\nReact typically ignores non-serializable or unsafe types like `Symbol` or `Function` for DOM attributes. However, prior to this change, these types were being stringified when used in `value` and `defaultValue` on input elements, resulting in unwanted output like \"Symbol()\" or \"function(){}\". This:\r\n\r\n- Violates expected rendering behavior.\r\n- Produces confusing or incorrect DOM states.\r\n- Contradicts React's design philosophy of preventing unsafe or invalid attribute usage.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis fix improves React's robustness and consistency by explicitly removing such attributes when `Symbol `or `Function` values are detected.\r\n\r\n## How did you test this change?\r\nTo ensure this fix behaves correctly and does not introduce regressions, the following validation steps were performed:\r\n\r\n1. Ran the specific test suite to confirm correctness of the fix:\r\n\r\n> yarn test ReactDOMAttribute-test\r\n\r\nThis verified that passing a Symbol or Function to value or defaultValue correctly results in the attribute being omitted from the DOM.\r\n\r\n2. Reviewed and updated snapshots:\r\n\r\nSome snapshot mismatches were expected due to the corrected behavior. After verifying their correctness, snapshots were updated using:\r\n\r\n> yarn test -u\r\n\r\n3. Executed the full test suite to confirm no regressions:\r\n\r\n> yarn test\r\n\r\n4. Ensured consistent code style:\r\n\r\n> yarn prettier\r\n> yarn lint\r\n\r\n5. Performed static type checking using Flow:\r\n\r\n> yarn flow\r\n\r\nThis comprehensive testing ensures that the fix is safe, focused, and maintains React\u2019s overall reliability.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Demonstrate the code is solid.

This happens due to the use of `.getAttribute(\"nonce\")` which returns `\"\"` for security reasons.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/2369#issuecomment-280622702\r\n\r\nThis link has a more information on the issue more specifically, but the change here is to use the `.nonce` _property_ (accessible) vs _attribute_ (inaccessible).\r\n\r\nWhile I don't have a reproduction case for it, it's possible that this also affects `style` tags, too. Because I was unable to test it, I've omitted that use case for now, though it should be easy enough to add.\r\n\r\n## How did you test this change?\r\n\r\nI copied the output file into the reproduction example (see below) and the problem is fixed.\r\n\r\n```\r\nyarn build\r\ncp build/node_modules/react-dom/cjs/react-dom-client.development.js ../with-strict-csp/node_modules/next/dist/compiled/react-dom/cjs/react-dom-client.development.js\r\n```\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. clone https://github.com/snyamathi/with-strict-csp\r\n2. npm ci\r\n3. npm run dev\r\n4. open dev page and observe hydration mismatch\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Demonstrate the code is solid.

This blocked UI development and local testing.\r\nSolution:\r\nUpdated packages/react-devtools-shell/package.json to include react, react-dom, and react-is as direct dependencies\r\nModified packages/react-devtools-shell/webpack-server.js to resolve React packages from node_modules (npm versions) instead of the non-existent local build directory\r\nThis allows developers to run the DevTools shell immediately after yarn install without needing to build React from source\r\n<!--\r\n Explain the **motivation** for making this change. What existing problem does the pull request solve?\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## How did you test this change?\r\n# 1. Forked repository and created branch from main\r\ngit checkout -b fix-devtools-shell-dependencies\r\n\r\n# 2. Ran yarn in repository root\r\nyarn install\r\n\r\n# 3.

This happened more frequently after enabling sibling prewarming which in some cases increased render counts that may have already been close to the limit.\r\n\r\nThis change enables a console error where we expect to throw (at 50 nested renders) while continuing to throw an error if that is hit 10 times (500 total nested renders being the new limit for throwing).\r\n\r\nThis is a temporary approach to allow us to collect more data about potential crashes in production, without introducing too many new crashes ourselves. We can measure the delta of warnings and crashes. The goal will be to make the mechanism smarter, maybe not counting prewarming passes for example, and/or adjusting the final limit to make it easier to enable this on existing apps.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/33744/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/33744/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/33731", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/33731/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/33731/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/33731/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/33731", "id": 3211227195, "node_id": "PR_kwDOAJy2Ks6d4IAC", "number": 33731, "title": "[Flight] Consistently encode sourceURLs", "user": {"login": "eps1lon", "id": 12292047, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjkyMDQ3", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12292047?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/eps1lon", "html_url": "https://github.com/eps1lon", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/eps1lon/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/eps1lon/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/eps1lon/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/eps1lon/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/eps1lon/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/eps1lon/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/eps1lon/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/eps1lon/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/eps1lon/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 196858374, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxOTY4NTgzNzQ=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/labels/CLA%20Signed", "name": "CLA Signed", "color": "e7e7e7", "default": false, "description": null}, {"id": 1775958285, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxNzc1OTU4Mjg1", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/labels/React%20Core%20Team", "name": "React Core Team", "color": "9149d1", "default": false, "description": "Opened by a member of the React Core Team"}], "state": "open", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2025-07-08T06:34:32Z", "updated_at": "2025-07-08T09:46:58Z", "closed_at": null, "author_association": "COLLABORATOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/pulls/33731", "html_url": "https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/33731", "diff_url": "https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/33731.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/33731.patch", "merged_at": null}, "body": "When a Server runs a Client reading from a third-party Server in the same VM, you might not want to implement `findSourceMapURL` for that Client in environments where HTTP is not available as a protocol in `sourceMappingURL` (e.g. Node.js).\r\n\r\nYou also won't know the source map URL of a given source in Node.js. Only its payload and serializing that into `data:` URLs is too memory intensive.\r\n\r\nWhen you don't implement `findSourceMapURL`, React always applied `encodeURI` to the originl `sourceURL`. This caused two problems:\r\n1. The stackframe that was created had an over-encoded location (e.g. when `sourceURL` was already a valid URL). You can't blindly apply `decodeURI` on locations in stack frames since you don't know if you're dealing with an original source URL or the source URL React encoded.\r\n2. React will create multiple fake scripts for the same source URL if `findSourceMapURL` returns no source mapping URL. This breaks debuggers since the original source will be overwritten with React's fake sources if `sourceURL === encodeURI(sourceURL)`\r\n\r\nNow we always use the same mechanism to create unique source URLs: `\"rsc://\" environmentName \"/\" originalSourceURL \"?\" fakeFunctionIdx`\r\n\r\n`environmentName` is put through `encodeURIComponent`.\r\n`originalSourceURL` is put through `encodeURI`.\r\n`fakeFunctionIdx` is a number with no meaning. It only exists to create unique sources.\r\n\r\nNot using `encodeURI` at all doesn't work for CommonJS where `getScriptNameOrSourceURL` returns the script name which is a file path. If we encode that into a file URL, `findSourceMap` will no longer work on the source URL from that fake script.", "reactions": {"url":

Although these values were defined in the `COLORS` object, they lacked corresponding CSS variables and were therefore rendered with incorrect or fallback colors.\r\n\r\nTo address this:\r\n\r\n- Added two new color tokens to the `COLORS` object: `SCROLL_TRACK` and `SCROLL_THUMB`\r\n- Updated `updateColorsToMatchTheme()` to read their values from `--color-scroll-track` and `--color-scroll-thumb`\r\n- Replaced the usage of `REACT_RESIZE_BAR` and `SCROLL_CARET` in the `draw()` method with the new `SCROLL_TRACK` and `SCROLL_THUMB` entries\r\n\r\nThe `REACT_RESIZE_BAR_BORDER` color was intentionally left unchanged, as there is no corresponding CSS variable defined for it.\r\n\r\nAs a result, the scrollbar visuals are now fully integrated with the theme system. Colors are dynamically resolved from CSS variables, removing the need for hardcoded placeholder values and improving maintainability and theming consistency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## How did you test this change?\r\n\r\n- Verified that all relevant colors are correctly populated via `updateColorsToMatchTheme()`\r\n- Manually tested scrollbar rendering under both light and dark themes\r\n- Confirmed that the following all pass:\r\n  - `yarn test`\r\n  - `yarn lint`\r\n  - `yarn flow dom-node`\r\n  - `yarn build`\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/33705/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/33705/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/33704", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/33704/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/33704/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/33704/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/33704", "id": 3204496201, "node_id": "PR_kwDOAJy2Ks6diLoR", "number": 33704, "title": "flow: remove $FlowFixMe[incompatible-type]", "user": {"login": "bubucuo", "id": 9839620, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjk4Mzk2MjA=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9839620?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bubucuo", "html_url": "https://github.com/bubucuo", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bubucuo/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bubucuo/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bubucuo/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bubucuo/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bubucuo/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bubucuo/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bubucuo/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bubucuo/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bubucuo/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 196858374, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxOTY4NTgzNzQ=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/labels/CLA%20Signed", "name": "CLA Signed", "color": "e7e7e7", "default": false, "description": null}], "state": "open", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2025-07-05T07:18:26Z", "updated_at": "2025-07-05T07:25:59Z", "closed_at": null, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/pulls/33704", "html_url": "https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/33704", "diff_url": "https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/33704.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/33704.patch", "merged_at": null}, "body": "Refine condition check and remove $FlowFixMe[incompatible-type]\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Thanks for submitting a pull request!\r\n  We appreciate you spending the time to work on these changes.
