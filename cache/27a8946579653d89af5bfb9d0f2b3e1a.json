However, it's possible to have updates coming into the blocking track while a gesture is animating (e.g. the setInterval in the fixture). It's therefore useful to be able to visualize the Gesture on its own track so that we can show sync updates at the same time as the animation.\r\n\r\nWe could potentially merge this with the Transition track but I find that a bit misleading. Especially since a Gesture would often then be followed by a Transition right after. So I added a separate track for it. It is its own lane after all. Although it's possible that maybe this track becomes the same as the Optimistic track if that's ever extracted out of sync.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"868\" height=\"449\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-09-20 at 1 26 49\u202fPM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68c5c944-b9ef-4979-a11c-2f3805acada6\" />\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/34546/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/34546/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/34543", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/34543/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/34543/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/34543/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/34543", "id": 3437267327, "node_id": "PR_kwDOAJy2Ks6pqAv5", "number": 34543, "title": "Include SyncLane in includesBlockingLane helper", "user": {"login": "sebmarkbage", "id": 63648, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjYzNjQ4", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63648?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/sebmarkbage", "html_url": "https://github.com/sebmarkbage", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sebmarkbage/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sebmarkbage/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sebmarkbage/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sebmarkbage/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sebmarkbage/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sebmarkbage/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sebmarkbage/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sebmarkbage/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sebmarkbage/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 196858374, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxOTY4NTgzNzQ=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/labels/CLA%20Signed", "name": "CLA Signed", "color": "e7e7e7", "default": false, "description": null}, {"id": 1775958285, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxNzc1OTU4Mjg1", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/labels/React%20Core%20Team", "name": "React Core Team", "color": "9149d1", "default": false, "description": "Opened by a member of the React Core Team"}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2025-09-20T16:02:29Z", "updated_at": "2025-09-24T13:34:35Z", "closed_at": "2025-09-24T13:34:35Z", "author_association": "COLLABORATOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/pulls/34543", "html_url": "https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/34543", "diff_url": "https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/34543.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/34543.patch", "merged_at": "2025-09-24T13:34:35Z"}, "body": "This helper weirdly doesn't include the sync lane.\r\n\r\nEverywhere we use it we have to check the sync lane separately.

pull request!\r\n  We appreciate you spending the time to work on these changes. Please provide enough information so that others can review your pull request. The three fields below are mandatory.\r\n\r\n  Before submitting a pull request, please make sure the following is done:\r\n\r\n  1. Fork [the repository](https://github.com/facebook/react) and create your branch from `main`.\r\n  2. Run `yarn` in the repository root.\r\n  3. If you've fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add tests!\r\n  4. Ensure the test suite passes (`yarn test`). Tip: `yarn test --watch TestName` is helpful in development.\r\n  5. Run `yarn test --prod` to test in the production environment. It supports the same options as `yarn test`.\r\n  6. If you need a debugger, run `yarn test --debug --watch TestName`, open `chrome://inspect`, and press \"Inspect\".\r\n  7. Format your code with [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) (`yarn prettier`).\r\n  8. Make sure your code lints (`yarn lint`). Tip: `yarn linc` to only check changed files.\r\n  9. Run the [Flow](https://flowtype.org/) type checks (`yarn flow`).\r\n  10. If you haven't already, complete the CLA.\r\n\r\n  Learn more about contributing: https://reactjs.org/docs/how-to-contribute.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nMade many small changes to the compiler playground to improve user experience. Removed any \"Loading\" indicators that would flash in before a component would finish loading in. Additionally, before users would see the \"Show Internals\" button toggling from false to true if they had set it at true previously. I was able to refactor the URL/local storage loading so that the `Store` would be fully initialized before the components would load in. \r\n\r\nAttempted to integrate `<Activity>` into showing/hiding these different editors, but the current state of [monaco editors](https://github.com/suren-atoyan/monaco-react) does not allow for this. I created an issue for them to address: https://github.com/suren-atoyan/monaco-react/issues/753\r\n\r\nAdded a debounce to the config editor so every key type wouldn't cause the output panel to respond instantly. Users can type for 500 ms before an error is thrown at them. \r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Explain the **motivation** for making this change. What existing problem does the pull request solve?\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## How did you test this change?\r\n\r\nHere is what loading the page would look like before (not sure why its so blurry):\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/58f4281a-cc02-4141-b9b5-f70d6ace12a2\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is how it looks now:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/40535165-fc7c-44fb-9282-9c7fa76e7d53\r\n\r\nHere is the debouncing:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e4ab29e4-1afd-4249-beca-671fb6542f5e\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Demonstrate the code is solid.

What existing problem does the pull request solve?\r\n--> The React Compiler rejected a default parameter that contains a TSInstantiationExpression with the todo message that the expression cannot be safely reordered. This change teaches the reorder check in BuildHIR.ts to treat TSInstantiationExpression as reorderable. This is safe because TypeScript instantiation only affects types and is erased at runtime, so it has no side effects and does not change semantics.\r\n\r\n## How did you test this change?\r\n\r\n```\r\nSet-Content testfilter.txt 'ts-instantiation-default-param'\r\n\r\nyarn test --filter --update\r\n\r\nyarn test --filter\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Demonstrate the code is solid. Example: The exact commands you ran and their output, screenshots / videos if the pull request changes the user interface.\r\n  How exactly did you verify that your PR solves the issue you wanted to solve?\r\n  If you leave this empty, your PR will very likely be closed.\r\n--> I added a fixture: \r\n> compiler/packages/babel-plugin-react-compiler/src/__tests__/fixtures/compiler/ts-instantiation-default-param.js", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/34488/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/34488/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/34521", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/34521/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/34521/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/34521/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/34521", "id": 3428061157, "node_id": "PR_kwDOAJy2Ks6pK3ET", "number": 34521, "title": "[compiler] Don't show hint about ref-like naming if we infer another type", "user": {"login": "josephsavona", "id": 6425824, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjU4MjQ=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6425824?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/josephsavona", "html_url": "https://github.com/josephsavona", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josephsavona/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josephsavona/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josephsavona/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josephsavona/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josephsavona/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josephsavona/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josephsavona/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josephsavona/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josephsavona/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 196858374, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxOTY4NTgzNzQ=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/labels/CLA%20Signed", "name": "CLA Signed", "color": "e7e7e7", "default": false, "description": null}, {"id": 1775958285, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxNzc1OTU4Mjg1", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/labels/React%20Core%20Team", "name": "React Core Team", "color": "9149d1", "default": false, "description": "Opened by a member of the React Core Team"}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2025-09-17T23:27:39Z", "updated_at": "2025-09-18T16:26:10Z", "closed_at": "2025-09-18T16:26:10Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/pulls/34521", "html_url": "https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/34521", "diff_url": "https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/34521.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/34521.patch", "merged_at": "2025-09-18T16:26:10Z"}, "body": "\nSome components accept a union of a ref callback function or ref object.

In that case we log \"Interrupted View Transition\".\r\n\r\nOtherwise, when we're done in `startViewTransition` there's some work to finalize the animations before the `ready` calllback. This is logged as \"Starting Animation\".\r\n\r\nThen there's a gap before the passive effects fire which we log as \"Animating\". This can be long unless they're forced to flush early e.g. due to another lane updating.\r\n\r\nThe \"Animating\" track should then pick up which doesn't do yet.

We've had that in the past but in general it doesn't work well because if you have a timeout and then give up you made everything wait longer for no benefit at the end. That's why the recommendation is to remove a Suspense boundary if you expect it to be fast and add one if you expect it to be slow. You have to estimate as the developer.\r\n\r\nSuspensey images suffer from this same problem. We want to apply suspensey images to as much as possible so that it's the default to avoid flashing because if just a few images flash it's still almost as bad as all of them. However, we do know that it's also very common to use images and on a slow connection or many images, it's not worth it so we have the timeout to eventually give up.\r\n\r\nHowever, this means that in cases that are always slow or connections that are always slow, you're always punished for no reason.\r\n\r\nSuspensey images is mainly a polish feature to make high end experiences on high end connections better but we don't want to unnecessarily punish all slow connections in the process or things like lots of images below the viewport.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds an estimate for whether or not we'll likely be able to load all the images within the timeout on a high end enough connection. If not, we'll still do a short suspend (unless we've already exceeded the wait time adjusted for #34478) to allow loading from cache if available.\r\n\r\nThis estimate is based on two heuristics:\r\n\r\n1) We compute an estimated bandwidth available on the current device in mbps. This is computed from performance entries that have loaded static resources already on the site. E.g. this can be other images, css, or scripts. We see how long they took. If we don't have any entries (or if they're all cross-origin in Safari) we fallback to `navigator.connection.downlink` in Chrome or a 5mbps default in Firefox/Safari.\r\n2) To estimate how many bytes we'll have to download we use the width/height props of the img tag if available (or a 100 pixel default) times the device pixel ratio. We assume that a good img implementation downloads proper resolution image for the device and defines a width/height up front to avoid layout trash. Then we estimate that it takes about 0.25 bytes per pixel which is somewhat conservative estimate.\r\n\r\nThis is somewhat conservative given that the image could've been preloaded and be better compressed.\r\n\r\nSo it really only kicks in for high end connections that are known to load fast.\r\n\r\nIn a follow up, we can add an additional wait for View Transitions that does the same estimate but only for the images that turn out to be in viewport.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/34481/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/34481/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/34478", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/34478/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/34478/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/34478/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/34478", "id": 3412471248, "node_id": "PR_kwDOAJy2Ks6oWnYR", "number": 34478, "title": "[Fiber] Adjust the suspensey image/css timeout based on already elapsed time", "user": {"login": "sebmarkbage", "id": 63648, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjYzNjQ4", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63648?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/sebmarkbage", "html_url": "https://github.com/sebmarkbage", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sebmarkbage/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sebmarkbage/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sebmarkbage/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sebmarkbage/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sebmarkbage/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sebmarkbage/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sebmarkbage/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sebmarkbage/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sebmarkbage/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 196858374, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxOTY4NTgzNzQ=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/labels/CLA%20Signed", "name": "CLA Signed", "color": "e7e7e7", "default": false, "description": null}, {"id": 1775958285, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxNzc1OTU4Mjg1", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/labels/React%20Core%20Team", "name": "React Core Team", "color": "9149d1", "default": false, "description": "Opened by a member of the React Core Team"}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2025-09-13T03:19:29Z", "updated_at": "2025-09-15T20:05:21Z", "closed_at": "2025-09-15T20:05:20Z", "author_association": "COLLABORATOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/pulls/34478", "html_url": "https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/34478", "diff_url": "https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/34478.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/34478.patch", "merged_at": "2025-09-15T20:05:20Z"}, "body": "Currently suspensey images doesn't account for how long we've already been waiting.

`<Activity />` to the `react@canary` release channel for final feedback and prepare for semver stable release. \r\n\r\n## What this means\r\n\r\nShipping `<Activity />` to canary means it has gone through extensive testing in production, we are confident in the stability of the feature, and we are preparing to release it in a future semver stable version. \r\n\r\nLibraries and frameworks following the [Canary Workflow](https://react.dev/blog/2023/05/03/react-canaries) should begin implementing and testing the feature.\r\n\r\n## Why we follow the Canary Workflow\r\n\r\nTo prepare for semver stable, libraries should test canary features like `<Activity>` with `react@canary` to confirm compatibility and prepare for the next semver release in a myriad of environments and configurations used throughout the React ecosystem. This provides libraries with ample time to catch any issues we missed before slamming them with problems in the wider semver release.\r\n\r\nSince these features have already gone through extensive production testing, and we are confident they are stable, frameworks following the [Canary Workflow](https://react.dev/blog/2023/05/03/react-canaries) can also begin adopting canary features like `<Activity />`. \r\n\r\nThis adoption is similar to how different Browsers implement new proposed browser features before they are added to the standard. If a frameworks adopts a canary feature, they are committing to stability for their users by ensuring any API changes before a semver stable release are opaque and non-breaking to their users.\r\n\r\nApps not using a framework are also free to adopt canary features like Activity as long as they follow the [Canary Workflow](https://react.dev/blog/2023/05/03/react-canaries), but we generally recommend waiting for a semver stable release unless you have the capacity to commit to following along with the canary changes and debugging library compatibility issues. \r\n\r\nWaiting for semver stable means you're able to benefit from libraries testing and confirming support, and use semver as signal for which version of a library you can use with support of the feature.\r\n\r\n## Docs \r\n\r\nCheck out the [\"React Labs: View Transitions, Activity, and more\"](https://react.dev/blog/2025/04/23/react-labs-view-transitions-activity-and-more#activity) blog post, and [the new docs

typically log the owner stack of the thing that caught the error. Similarly we restore the `console.createTask` scope of the catching component when we call `reportError` or `console.error`.\r\n\r\nWe also have a special case if something throws during reconciliation which uses the Server Component task as far as we got before we threw.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/blob/main/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactChildFiber.js#L1952-L1960\r\n\r\nChrome has since fixed it (on our request) that the Error constructor snapshots the Task at the time the constructor was created and logs that in `reportError`. This is a good thing since it means we get a coherent stack. Unfortunately, it means that the fake Errors that we create in Flight Client gets a snapshot of the task where they were created so when they're reported in the console they get the root Task instead of the Task of the handler of the error.\r\n\r\nIdeally we'd transfer the Task from the server and restore it. However, since we don't instrument the Error object to snapshot the owner and we can't read the native Task (if it's even enabled on the server) we don't actually have a correct snapshot to transfer for a Server Component Error. However, we can use the parent's task for where the error was observed by Flight Server and then encode that as a pseudo owner of the Error.\r\n\r\nThen we use this owner as the Task which the Error is created within. Now the client snapshots that Task which is reported by `reportError` so now we have an async stack for Server Component errors again. (Note that this owner may differ from the one observed by `captureOwnerStack` which gets the nearest Server Component from where it was caught. We could attach the owner to the Error object and use that owner when calling `onCaughtError`/`onUncaughtError`).\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"911\" height=\"57\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-09-10 at 10 57 54\u202fAM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0446ef96-fad9-4e17-8a9a-d89c334233ec\" />\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"910\" height=\"128\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-09-10 at 11 06 20\u202fAM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b30e5892-cf40-4246-a588-0f309575439b\" />\r\n\r\nSimilarly, there are Errors and warnings created by ChildFiber itself. Those execute in the scope of the general render of the parent Fiber. They used to get the scope of the nearest client component parent (e.g. div in this case) but that's the parent of the Server Component. It would be too expensive to run every level of reconciliation in its own task optimistically, so this does it only when we know that we'll throw or log an error that needs this context. Unfortunately this doesn't cover user space errors (such as if an iterable errors).\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"903\" height=\"298\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-09-10 at 11 31 55\u202fAM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cffc94da-8c14-4d6e-9a5b-bf0833b8b762\" />\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1216\" height=\"252\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-09-10 at 11 50 54\u202fAM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f85f93cf-ab73-4046-af3d-dd93b73b3552\" />\r\n\r\n<img width=\"412\" height=\"115\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-09-10 at 11 52 46\u202fAM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a76cef7b-b162-4ecf-9b0a-68bf34afc239\" />\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/34460/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/34460/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/34468", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/34468/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/34468/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/34468/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/34468", "id": 3407594687, "node_id": "PR_kwDOAJy2Ks6oF-H8", "number": 34468, "title": "[playground] Update the playground UI", "user": {"login": "EugeneChoi4", "id": 20482229, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDgyMjI5", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20482229?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/EugeneChoi4", "html_url": "https://github.com/EugeneChoi4", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/EugeneChoi4/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/EugeneChoi4/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/EugeneChoi4/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/EugeneChoi4/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/EugeneChoi4/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/EugeneChoi4/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/EugeneChoi4/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/EugeneChoi4/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/EugeneChoi4/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 196858374, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxOTY4NTgzNzQ=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/labels/CLA%20Signed", "name": "CLA Signed", "color": "e7e7e7", "default": false, "description": null}, {"id": 1775958285, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxNzc1OTU4Mjg1", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/labels/React%20Core%20Team", "name": "React Core Team", "color": "9149d1", "default": false, "description": "Opened by a member of the React Core Team"}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2025-09-11T18:11:45Z", "updated_at": "2025-09-12T15:43:05Z", "closed_at": "2025-09-12T15:43:05Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/pulls/34468", "html_url": "https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/34468", "diff_url": "https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/34468.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/34468.patch", "merged_at": "2025-09-12T15:43:05Z"}, "body": "<!--\r\n  Thanks for submitting a pull request!\r\n  We appreciate you spending the time to work on these changes.

Now, it will automatically update the output pane each time there is an edit to the config.

If something suspended within the Suspense boundary but outside the Activity it's not included even if it's also suspending inside the Activity since we assume it would've already been loaded then.\r\n\r\nRight now I wire this up to be a special case when you select an Activity boundary same as when you select a Suspense boundary in the Components tab but we could also only use this when you select the root in the Suspense tab for example.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/34438/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/34438/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/34435", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/34435/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/34435/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/34435/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/34435", "id": 3399453233, "node_id": "PR_kwDOAJy2Ks6nqMrF", "number": 34435, "title": "[DevTools] Only show the highest end/byteSize I/O of RSC streams", "user": {"login": "sebmarkbage", "id": 63648, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjYzNjQ4", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63648?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/sebmarkbage", "html_url": "https://github.com/sebmarkbage", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sebmarkbage/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sebmarkbage/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sebmarkbage/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sebmarkbage/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sebmarkbage/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sebmarkbage/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sebmarkbage/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sebmarkbage/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sebmarkbage/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 196858374, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxOTY4NTgzNzQ=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/labels/CLA%20Signed", "name": "CLA Signed", "color": "e7e7e7", "default": false, "description": null}, {"id": 1775958285, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxNzc1OTU4Mjg1", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/labels/React%20Core%20Team", "name": "React Core Team", "color": "9149d1", "default": false, "description": "Opened by a member of the React Core Team"}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2025-09-09T18:11:54Z", "updated_at": "2025-09-10T13:08:36Z", "closed_at": "2025-09-10T13:08:36Z", "author_association": "COLLABORATOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/pulls/34435", "html_url": "https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/34435", "diff_url": "https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/34435.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/34435.patch", "merged_at": "2025-09-10T13:08:36Z"}, "body": "Stacked on #34425.\r\n\r\nRSC stream info is split into one I/O entry per chunk.

The spec doesn't specify the error message to use but it's more useful to have a specific one for each case like Safari does.\r\n\r\nOne reason it's better to have a specific error message is because the browser console is not the main surface that people look for errors. Chrome relies on a separate log also in the console. Frameworks has built-in error dialogs that pop up first and that's where you see the error and that dialog can't show something specific. Additionally, these errors can't log something specific to servers in production logging. So this is a bad strategy.\r\n\r\nIt's not good to have those error dialogs pop up for non-actionable errors like when it doesn't start because the document was hidden. Since we don't have more specific information we have no choice but to hide all of them.

We previously added the MaybeAlias effect in #33984 in order to describe the semantic that an unknown function call _may_ alias its return value in its result, but that we don't know this for sure. We record mutations through MaybeAlias edges when walking backward in the data flow graph, but downgrade them to conditional mutations. See the original PR for full context.\n\nThat change was sufficient for the original case like\n\n```js\nconst frozen = useContext();\nuseEffect(() => {\n  frozen.method().property = true;\n}, [...]);\n```\n\nBut it wasn't sufficient for cases where the aliasing occured between operands:\n\n```js\nconst dispatch = useDispatch();\n<div onClick={(e) => {\n  dispatch(...e.target.value)\n  e.target.value = ...;\n}} />\n```\n\nHere we would record a `Capture dispatch <- e.target` effect. Then during processing of the `event.target.value = ...` assignment we'd eventually  _forward_ from `event` to `dispatch` (along a MaybeAlias edge).

This tracks an I/O entry for each Promise (`SomeChunk<T>`) that represents the request to the RSC stream. As the value we use the `Response` for `createFromFetch` (or the `ReadableStream` for `createFromReadableStream`). The start time is when you called those.\r\n\r\nSince we're not awaiting the whole stream, each I/O entry represents the part of the stream up until it got unblocked. However, in a production environment with TLS packets and buffering in practice the chunks received by the client isn't exactly at the boundary of each row. It's a bit longer into larger chunks. From testing, it seems like multiples of 16kb or 64kb uncompressed are common. To simulate a production environment we group into roughly 64kb chunks if they happen in rapid sequence. Note that this might be too small to give a good idea because of the throttle many boundaries might be skipped anyway so this might show too many.\r\n\r\nThe React DevTools will see each I/O entry as separate but dedupe if an outer boundary already depends on the same chunk. This deduping makes it so that small boundaries that are blocked on the same chunk, don't get treated as having unique suspenders. If you have a boundary with large content, then that content will likely be in a separate chunk which is not in the parent and then it gets marked as.\r\n\r\nThis is all just an approximation. The goal of this is just to highlight that very large boundaries will very likely suspend even if they don't suspend on any I/O on the server. In practice, these boundaries can float around a lot and it's really any Suspense boundary that might suspend but some are more likely than others which this is meant to highlight.\r\n\r\nIt also just lets you inspect how many bytes needs to be transferred before you can show a particular part of the content, to give you an idea that it's not just I/O on the server that might suspend.\r\n\r\nIf you don't use the debug channel it can be misleading since the data in development mode stream will have a lot more data in it which leads to more chunking.\r\n\r\nSimilarly to \"client references\" these I/O infos don't have an \"env\" since it's the client that has the I/O and so those are excluded from flushing in the Server performance tracks.\r\n\r\nNote that currently the same Response can appear many times in the same Instance of SuspenseNode in DevTools when there are multiple chunks. In a follow up I'll show only the last one per Response at any given level.\r\n\r\nNote that when a separate debugChannel is used it has its own I/O entry that's on the `_debugInfo` for the debug chunks in that channel. However, if everything works correctly these should never leak into the DevTools UI since they should never be propagated from a debug chunk to the values waited by the runtime.

The more complete solution would be to validate that there is a subgraph of reactive scopes with a single input and output node, where the input node has the same dependencies as the original useMemo, and the output has the same outputs. That is true in this case, with the subgraph being the two consecutive scopes mentioned above.\n\nBut that's complicated. As a shortcut, this PR checks for any dependencies that are defined after the start of the original useMemo. If we find one, we know that it's a case where we were able to memoize more precisely than the original, and we don't report an error on the dependency. We still check that the original _output_ value is able to be memoized, though.

The logic is inspired by a custom Next.js transform, flagged to us by @eps1lon, that does something similar. Implementing this transform within React Compiler means that all React (Compiler) users can benefit from more helpful names when debugging.\n\nThe idea builds on the fact that JS engines try to infer helpful names for anonymous functions (in stack traces) when those functions are accessed through an object property lookup:\n\n```js\n({'a[xyz]': () => {\n  throw new Error('hello!')\n} }['a[xyz]'])()\n\n// Stack trace:\nUncaught Error: hello!\n    at a[xyz] (<anonymous>:1:26) // <-- note the name here\n    at <anonymous>:1:60\n```\n\nThe new NameAnonymousFunctions transform is gated by the above flag, which is off by default. It attemps to infer names for functions as follows:\n\nFirst, determine a \"local\" name:\n* Assigning a function to a named variable uses the variable name. `const f = () => {}` gets the name \"f\".\n* Passing the function as an argument to a function gets the name of the function, ie `foo(() => ...)` get the name \"foo()\", `foo.bar(() => ...)` gets the name \"foo.bar()\". Note the parenthesis to help understand that it was part of a call.\n* Passing the function to a known hook uses the name of the hook, `useEffect(() => ...)` uses \"useEffect()\".\n* Passing the function as a JSX prop uses the element and attr name, eg `<div onClick={() => ...}` uses \"<div>.onClick\".\n\nSecond, the local name is combined with the name of the outer component/hook, so the final names will be strings like `Component[f]` or `useMyHook[useEffect()]`.\n\n---\n[//]: # (BEGIN SAPLING FOOTER)\nStack created with [Sapling](https://sapling-scm.com).
