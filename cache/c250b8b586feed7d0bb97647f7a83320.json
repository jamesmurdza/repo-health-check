This is unergonomic for users who'd have to wrap it in `Partial<PluginOptions>`. However, this is not even sufficient to properly type `environment`. The correct type would've been `Partial<Omit<PluginOptions, 'environment'>> & {environment: Partial<EnvironmentConfig>}`.\r\n\r\nThis is no longer a trivial type construction so it warrants a dedicated type.

However, it's possible to have updates coming into the blocking track while a gesture is animating (e.g. the setInterval in the fixture). It's therefore useful to be able to visualize the Gesture on its own track so that we can show sync updates at the same time as the animation.\r\n\r\nWe could potentially merge this with the Transition track but I find that a bit misleading. Especially since a Gesture would often then be followed by a Transition right after. So I added a separate track for it. It is its own lane after all. Although it's possible that maybe this track becomes the same as the Optimistic track if that's ever extracted out of sync.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"868\" height=\"449\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-09-20 at 1 26 49\u202fPM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68c5c944-b9ef-4979-a11c-2f3805acada6\" />\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/34546/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/34546/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/34543", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/34543/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/34543/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/34543/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/34543", "id": 3437267327, "node_id": "PR_kwDOAJy2Ks6pqAv5", "number": 34543, "title": "Include SyncLane in includesBlockingLane helper", "user": {"login": "sebmarkbage", "id": 63648, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjYzNjQ4", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63648?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/sebmarkbage", "html_url": "https://github.com/sebmarkbage", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sebmarkbage/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sebmarkbage/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sebmarkbage/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sebmarkbage/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sebmarkbage/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sebmarkbage/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sebmarkbage/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sebmarkbage/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sebmarkbage/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 196858374, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxOTY4NTgzNzQ=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/labels/CLA%20Signed", "name": "CLA Signed", "color": "e7e7e7", "default": false, "description": null}, {"id": 1775958285, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxNzc1OTU4Mjg1", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/labels/React%20Core%20Team", "name": "React Core Team", "color": "9149d1", "default": false, "description": "Opened by a member of the React Core Team"}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2025-09-20T16:02:29Z", "updated_at": "2025-09-24T13:34:35Z", "closed_at": "2025-09-24T13:34:35Z", "author_association": "COLLABORATOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/pulls/34543", "html_url": "https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/34543", "diff_url": "https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/34543.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/34543.patch", "merged_at": "2025-09-24T13:34:35Z"}, "body": "This helper weirdly doesn't include the sync lane.\r\n\r\nEverywhere we use it we have to check the sync lane separately.

pull request!\r\n  We appreciate you spending the time to work on these changes. Please provide enough information so that others can review your pull request. The three fields below are mandatory.\r\n\r\n  Before submitting a pull request, please make sure the following is done:\r\n\r\n  1. Fork [the repository](https://github.com/facebook/react) and create your branch from `main`.\r\n  2. Run `yarn` in the repository root.\r\n  3. If you've fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add tests!\r\n  4. Ensure the test suite passes (`yarn test`). Tip: `yarn test --watch TestName` is helpful in development.\r\n  5. Run `yarn test --prod` to test in the production environment. It supports the same options as `yarn test`.\r\n  6. If you need a debugger, run `yarn test --debug --watch TestName`, open `chrome://inspect`, and press \"Inspect\".\r\n  7. Format your code with [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) (`yarn prettier`).\r\n  8. Make sure your code lints (`yarn lint`). Tip: `yarn linc` to only check changed files.\r\n  9. Run the [Flow](https://flowtype.org/) type checks (`yarn flow`).\r\n  10. If you haven't already, complete the CLA.\r\n\r\n  Learn more about contributing: https://reactjs.org/docs/how-to-contribute.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Explain the **motivation** for making this change. What existing problem does the pull request solve?\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded more tests for the compiler playground with the addition of the new config editor and \"Show Internals\" button. Added testing to check for incomplete store params in the URL, toggle functionality, and correct errors showing for syntax/validation errors in the config overrides.

In that case we log \"Interrupted View Transition\".\r\n\r\nOtherwise, when we're done in `startViewTransition` there's some work to finalize the animations before the `ready` calllback. This is logged as \"Starting Animation\".\r\n\r\nThen there's a gap before the passive effects fire which we log as \"Animating\". This can be long unless they're forced to flush early e.g. due to another lane updating.\r\n\r\nThe \"Animating\" track should then pick up which doesn't do yet. This one is tricky because this is after the actual commit phase and needs to be interrupted by new renders which themselves can be suspended on the animation finshing.\r\n\r\nThis PR is just a subset of all the cases.
